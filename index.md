Hello ðŸ‘‹  
I am a web developer who loves working remotely :)  
I write code to make my life easier and by extension, help others.

Here are some keywords that can help describe me:
- git
- ruby
- rails
- javascript
- keeping it simple
- shipping early
- playing to one's strengths
- open mind and creativity
- communication
- remote
- patience
- long term projects
- mistakes and learning
- improvement through iteration
- experimentation
- reusable code

Below are some experimental projects that I am working on.  
I split my time between art and code projects, looking for the overlap between.
