Hello!  
I write code to make my life easier and by extension, help others.

Here are some things I stand by:
- keeping it simple
- shipping early
- taking notes
- playing to one's strengths
- openness and creativity
- opinionated
- communication
- working remotely
- long term projects
- improvement through iteration
- experimentation
- recycling code
- code as art

Below are some experimental projects that I am working on.  
I split my time between art and code projects, looking for the overlap between.  
For my commercial work [read the CV.](/cv)
