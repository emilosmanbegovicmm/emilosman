Hello ðŸ‘‹  
I am a web developer who loves working remotely :)  
I write code to make my life easier and by extension, help others.

Looking to hire me? Are you a company that:

1. needs a passionate, self motivated web developer
2. values the freedom of their employees
3. trusts employees to make a technological or idealogical decisions
4. needs a developer that could learn an entirely new technological stack
5. needs an employee that wants to help your company grow and succeed
6. wants a programming engineer that cares about backend, frontend, database and user experience

Here are some keywords that can help describe me:
- git
- ruby
- rails
- javascript
- keeping it simple
- shipping early
- playing to one's strengths
- open mind and creativity
- communication
- remote
- patience
- long term projects
- mistakes and learning
- improvement through iteration
- experimentation
- reusable code

Below are some experimental projects that I am working on.  
I split my time between art and code projects, looking for the overlap between.
